Displays popup photo thumbnails on mouseover of links Flickr photo pages.

== Description ==

FlickrTips is a simple AJAX enhancement to hyperlinks within a Wordpress blog.  When a link to a Flickr photo page
is moused over by the user, a small panel will appear near the mouse cursor with a thumbnail of the Flickr image.
The panel disappears when the mouse leaves the link.

This behaviour is disabled for links that contain images, since it would probably be redundant.

== Installation ==

1. unpack `flickrtips.zip` into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.  This should create a `flickrtips` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's all there is to it!  No modifications to your WordPress templates are needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
