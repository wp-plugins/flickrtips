Displays popup photo thumbnails on mouseover of links to Flickr photo pages.

== Description ==

FlickrTips is a simple AJAX enhancement to hyperlinks within a Wordpress blog.  When a link to a Flickr photo page
is moused over by the user, a small panel will appear near the mouse cursor with a thumbnail of the Flickr image.
The panel disappears when the mouse leaves the link.

This behaviour is disabled for links that contain images, since it would probably be redundant.

Verified on Windows IE 6-7, Safari 2, Firefox 2, and Opera 9.

== Installation ==

1. unpack and upload `flickrtips` directory into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's all there is to it!  No modifications to your WordPress templates are needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
